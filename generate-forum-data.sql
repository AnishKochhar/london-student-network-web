-- Script to generate realistic forum data for testing
--
-- This script creates 50 threads with comments, replies, tags, and votes using EXISTING users.
-- No fake users are created - it uses your real user accounts and generates usernames for them.
--
-- PREREQUISITES:
--   1. Run database-migration-add-usernames.sql first
--   2. Have at least 3 real users in your users table
--
-- WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
--   1. Creates realistic usernames for existing users (based on their role)
--   2. Generates 50 diverse forum threads with realistic content
--   3. Creates 2-15 comments per thread with realistic responses
--   4. Adds nested replies (30% chance, 1-3 replies per comment)
--   5. Generates realistic voting patterns
--   6. Assigns 1-3 tags per thread from available categories
--
-- The generated content simulates a real student forum with discussions about:
-- academics, housing, career advice, social events, mental health, technology, etc.

-- First, let's create some forum tags if they don't exist
