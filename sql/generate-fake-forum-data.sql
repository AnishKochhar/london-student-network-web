-- Script to generate completely fake forum data with fake users
--
-- This script creates fake test users and uses them to populate the forum with realistic content.
-- All fake users use email domain @test-forum.local for easy identification and cleanup.
--
-- PREREQUISITES:
--   1. Run database-migration-add-usernames.sql first
--   2. Ensure users, usernames, threads, comments tables exist
--
-- CLEANUP:
--   To remove all fake data: DELETE FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@test-forum.local';
--   (Cascading deletes will remove all associated data)

-- First, let's create some forum tags if they don't exist
INSERT INTO forum_tags (name) VALUES
    ('General Discussion'),
    ('Academic'),
    ('Social Events'),
    ('Career Advice'),
