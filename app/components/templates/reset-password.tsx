            <p>Hello ${email}, the moment you've been waiting for has arrived! (Or, the moment since you clicked "Forgot Password.")</p>
            <p>You recently requested to <strong>reset your password</strong>. We all forget out passwords from time to time and we're here to help! Here's your personalised link to reset your password.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
			<p>Use this link wisely, for with great password-resetting power comes great responsibility. (Okay, maybe not, but still.)</p>
			<p>May your new password be strong and your memory even stronger.</p>
			<p>If the above link does not work, just copy/paste this link into your browser: <a href="${resetLink}">${resetLink}</a></p>
            <p>If you did not request this, please ignore this email.</p>
